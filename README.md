# Capstone-Project-Object-Detection
Project Overview: Developed and implemented a deep learning model for object detection in autonomous driving systems, contributing to the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles.

Phase 1: Model Design:
Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture tailored for object detection in driving environments.

Conducted extensive data preprocessing, including preparing and refining training datasets.

Fine-tuned the CNN model to ensure high accuracy and efficiency in detecting critical objects.

Phase 2: Data Quality Assurance:
Checked data types and treated missing values to ensure data integrity.

Removed non-essential columns and cleaned up dataset features to optimize for model training.

Prepared the dataset for further analysis, focusing on data quality and readiness for deployment.

Outcome: The project provided a robust deep learning solution that enhances the ability of autonomous vehicles to detect and respond to their surroundings effectively.
